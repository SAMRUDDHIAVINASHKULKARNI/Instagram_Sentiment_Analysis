# Instagram_Sentiment_Analysis
Sentiment Analysis involves working out whether a piece of text is positive, negative or neutral. In this project I have used nltk library and VADER lexicon. nltk library is used to process human language, it provides sentiment analysis of human data. VADER is Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner. It also takes into account the intensity of the sentiment.
